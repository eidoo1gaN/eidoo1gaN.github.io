			<br> Shout out to the tutorial that helped me! ^^^		

		<h5> Nerd alert!!!!!!!!</h5> <p> <br> this <br> is <br> a <br> very <br> long explenation. I whipped this up in about 30 mins. <br> This is just a bad placeholder, so it is completly open to change and revisions. <br> I have big dreams for this page. I think we could do chess, mabye code a chat room. <br> The thing is though, it has to be a stagnant website, so hosted without a server. There. this looks <b>BAD</b> on the website lol. </p>
